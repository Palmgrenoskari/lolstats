## Dev Roadmap

Some kind of rough roadmap of the top of my head. Truth is its definitely not going to be this organized heh:</br>
<b>Bolded</b> = currently working on

1. <b>Front: Achieve some basic look, have a navbar with a few different routes that each show some kind of information about league</b>
2. <b>Front & Back: Implement ability to fetch league of legends account information by name and region. Figure out the Riot dev API and achieve decent integration between front and back. Implement leaderboards? </b>
3. Back: Add in DB, most likely mongoDB
4. Front and back: Authentication, ability to create account, login -> store credentials encrypted to mongoDB
5. Figure out whether we need some better state management, perhaps change to typescript if I feel confident about it, stylings++ bootstrap/tailwind, more functionalities, ... <b>I mean let's first get this far ^</b>
